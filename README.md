# Native New Tab for Firefox
*Eyes burning when you open about:blank?*

Firefox's new tab and homepage don't respect the "Default" theme background color unlike all other internal Firefox pages. This addon aims to rectify that by providing a new tab that uses the internal "common.css" file to style itself. (like everything else)

Also the whole *"not respecting the Default theme"* is actually a bug! Bugzilla tracker:
